# 500 pages

500 pages are used to tell users that we [HMRC] have a problem that was not their fault.

They cover a range of situations when something has gone wrong with the server.

500 errors should only be displayed to users for a short time. The standard approach within HMRC is to [shutter](http://hmrc-design-language-prototype.herokuapp.com/design-patterns/patterns/pages/shutter_pages/) a service, if there is going to be a disruption to users for an extended period of time.

500 errors should be logged by services and fixed as a matter of priority.

There are a number of [standard pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#5xx_Server_error) that fall into the category of 500 pages. We do not need different error pages to cover all of these situations.

## Why users see 500 pages

For the purposes of HMRC services there are 3 scenarios when we would need to show users a 500 page:

- 500 Internal Server Error
- 503 Service Unavailable
- 504 Gateway Timeout

## 500 page design

When displaying a 500 page we should:

- use the <a href="">standard template</a>
- explain to users whats going on
- tell users what they can do, if anything to resolve the issue.
- If there is an alternative channel that they can use to continue their transaction this should be made available to them.
